The OGP, an office within the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, is responsible for sourcing goods and services on behalf of the public service. This procurement is a central purchasing initiative aimed at providing a comprehensive framework for various public sector bodies, including but not limited to, central government, local government, education, and health sectors.\n\nThe framework agreement will be used by Framework Clients, as defined in Section 1.4 of the RFT, to procure virtualisation software and associated reseller services. The services described in Appendix 1 to this RFT include, but are not limited to, the provision of virtualisation software licenses, technical support, and consultancy services related to virtualisation solutions.\n\nTo be considered for appointment to this multi-supplier framework agreement, tenderers must demonstrate their ability to provide high-quality virtualisation software and associated reseller services. The evaluation criteria will focus on factors such as cost, quality, technical capability, and the ability to deliver value for money.\n\nTenderers should have a proven track record in providing similar services to public sector bodies. They must also comply with all relevant public procurement regulations and guidelines set by the OGP. The successful tenderers will be appointed to the framework agreement for a specified period, during which they will be required to provide the services as described in the RFT.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the detailed specifications outlined in Appendix 1 of the RFT. The OGP encourages all eligible economic operators to participate in this tender process to contribute to the efficient and effective delivery of public works projects.",
