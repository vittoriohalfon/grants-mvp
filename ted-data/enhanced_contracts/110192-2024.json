    "description": "**Title:** The Provision of Breeding Seabird Surveys at a Selection of SPAs in Donegal, 2024 (1202_BSSD24)\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is seeking a suitably qualified and experienced team to undertake fieldwork in early June 2024. The objective of this project is to provide contemporary population estimates of the breeding seabird populations in the Horn Head to Fanad Head Special Protection Area (SPA), as well as in Tory Island SPA and Inishbofin, Inishdooey, and Inishbeg SPAs.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Location:** The surveys will focus on the seabird colonies at Horn Head, Tory Island, and Inishbofin, Inishdooey, and Inishbeg.\n- **Species:** The project will cover the following species:\n  - Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis)\n  - Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo)\n  - Shag (Gulosus aristotelis)\n  - Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla)\n  - Guillemot (Uria aalge)\n  - Razorbill (Alca torda)\n  - Puffin (Fratercula arctica)\n  - Common Gull (Larus canus)\n  - Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus)\n  - Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea)\n- **Conservation Context:** The project aims to inform effective conservation management of Ireland’s SPA Network by providing contemporary population estimates at various geographic scales, from site to national levels.\n- **Importance:** Horn Head is one of the most important seabird colonies both in the northwest and nationally, making this resurvey crucial for conservation efforts.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- The bidder must be suitably qualified and experienced in conducting seabird surveys.\n- The team should have expertise in ornithology, ecology, and fieldwork methodologies.\n- The bidder should be able to provide detailed population estimates and data analysis.\n- The project timeline is set for early June 2024, with a focus on completing the fieldwork within a specified period.\n\n**Submission Guidelines:**\n- Bidders should submit their proposals electronically through the gov.ie portal.\n- Proposals should include detailed methodologies, team qualifications, and a timeline for completion.\n- The NPWS reserves the right to request additional information or clarification during the evaluation process.\n\nBy engaging a qualified and experienced team, the NPWS aims to ensure the successful completion of this critical conservation project, contributing to the effective management of Ireland’s SPA Network.",

      "description": "The area known as Horn Head accounts for the vast majority of the listed breeding seabirds of Horn Head to Fanad Head SPA, which are: Fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis; Cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo; Shag, Gulosus aristotelis; Kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla; Guillemot, Uria aalge; and Razorbill, Alca torda. Horn Head is in close proximity to Tory Island SPA (seabird SCIs of Fulmar, Razorbill and Puffin, Fratercula arctica) and Inishbofin, Inishdooey and Inishbeg SPA (seabird SCIs of Common Gull, Larus canus; Lesser Black-backed Gull, Larus fuscus; and Arctic Tern, Sterna paradisaea). Effective conservation management of Ireland’s SPA Network is informed by contemporary population estimates of the relevant species at various geographic scales i.e. from the site to the national level. Horn Head is one of the most important seabird colonies both in the northwest and nationally. A resurvey of this colony along with the seabirds of Tory Island SPA and Inishbofin, Inishdooey and Inishbeg SPA is now due. NPWS are seeking a suitably qualified and experienced team to undertake field work in early June in order to provide contemporary population estimates of the aforementioned areas’ breeding seabird populations.",
