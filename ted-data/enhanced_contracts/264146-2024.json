    "title": "Tender for the Provision of After Hours First Aid Support Services to MTU",
    "description": "Munster Technological University is seeking tenders from competent service providers for the provision of After-hours First Aid Support Service to MTU. Currently, in hours emergency care is provided on a voluntary basis by staff of the University who respond to incidents on campus and in the immediate environs of the University (for example students have been injured in collisions while crossing the road from the bus stop). The successful tenderer will provide an after-hours first aid service during assigned dates within Semesters 1 and 2. The service is required primarily on the MTU Bishopstown Campus and occasionally on other campuses, generally between the hours of 5pm and 10pm - Monday to Friday and 10am to 4pm – each Saturday and as required on Sundays: approx.6 to 8 per semester. Additional supports may be required, possibly during business hours, for events hosted on MTU campuses. The scope of this tender request is for the provision of a Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) licensed service provider to supply a privileged Practitioner (EMT) to respond to accidents, incidents or medical events that may occur during the hours they are scheduled to be on campus. It is further envisaged that the tenderer will also privilege a small number (up to three at present) of University employees who are PHECC registered EMTs. It will be explicitly agreed that any response undertaken by the MTU employees as EMT’s outside of these times or in other locations shall not be covered by the successful tenderer. It is also agreed that any reasonable training of the University EMTs required by the tenderer, where their existing training is deemed inadequate or incomplete, shall be carried out at no expense to the tenderer.",
