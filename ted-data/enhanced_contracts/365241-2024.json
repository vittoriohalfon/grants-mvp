    "description": "Munster Technological University is seeking tenders from competent providers for the Supply and Delivery of Leisurewear to MTU Cork Campus and MTU Kerry Campus’s. MTU wishes to create a multi supplier framework for this tender. MTU Cork/Kerry have long traditions in sport with over 50 Sports Clubs across both MTU Cork Campus and MTU Kerry Campus. The leisurewear requirements consist of sport leisurewear for the different MTU clubs and leisurewear that can be purchased by different departments. Suitable suppliers will not only need to reliably supply large quantities of leisurewear to Departments in both MTU Cork and Kerry Campuses but also smaller quantities of Leisurewear to individual clubs and departments. All gear must be Machine Washable/Tumble Dried. As multiple departments will be placing orders there will be a need for the winning company/ies to set up one MTU account where multiple departments can order under. Orders are only to be accepted with department and contact name. A company may submit proposals for one or more lots. A company can be awarded more than one or all lots. Not all items on the list may be purchased Samples may be requested for samples for Quality purposes. Please also submit quotes, where appropriate, for your company's larger children's sizes / youth (e.g age 11/12 and age 13/14) if price differs to adult sizes. Images supplied are for reference only and style and colours will be confirmed at order stage Full details can be found in Appendix 1: Requirements and Specifications.
