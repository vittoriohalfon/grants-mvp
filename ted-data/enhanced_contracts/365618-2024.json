    "description": "**Title: 20-054 St Marys Baldoyle**\n\n**Description:**\nSt. Mary's Secondary School, a Catholic all-girls voluntary secondary school under the trusteeship of the Religious Sisters of Charity, is seeking a reliable and efficient contractor to replace the space heating system throughout the building, excluding two specific areas. The project also involves upgrading the boiler plantroom to ensure optimal functionality and energy efficiency. The school is committed to maintaining a comfortable and conducive learning environment, and the selected bidder must demonstrate expertise in managing complex school infrastructure projects, particularly in the context of a co-educational setting. The successful contractor will be expected to work closely with the school administration and staff to minimize disruptions during the installation process. The project timeline is critical, and the bidder must provide a detailed plan for completion within the specified timeframe. Additionally, the contractor should have experience with Vodafone's Schools' Connected Project, as the school is a Vodafone European Pilot School, and integration with existing IT infrastructure is essential. The proposal should include a comprehensive risk assessment, detailed project timeline, and a plan for ensuring the safety of students and staff during the installation process.",
