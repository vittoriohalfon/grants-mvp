The OEMS system should include the following: • An OEMS Gas Analysis System with integrated mass spectrometer • Vacuum pump • Spare components and accessories including ultralow flow capillaries, input/output connections for residual gas analyser • Interface cable(s) to enable communication and data transfer between the OEMS system and a potentiostat • Be capable of measuring gases evolved during the charging/discharging processes of prototype lithiumion, sodium-ion and lithium–sulfur batteries. • Be compatible with commercially available battery test cells with gas inlets/outlets for example EL-CELL PAT-Cell-Gas cells (or similar) • Be able to detect low volumes of gases on a microlitre range • Be able to analyse carrier gas containing evolved gas(es) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min • Have a mass range of 0 – 200 atomic mass units (amu) • System software which allows the user to set and scan the electron energy in desired eV increments. • A gas analysis system with an easily accessible multiport manifold to enable different inlet interfaces, for dissolved species and headspace species.",
