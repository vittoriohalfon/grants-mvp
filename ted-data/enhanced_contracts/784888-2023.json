In conjunction with the forthcoming publication of the Guidelines, the NCSE has been asked to procure training for schools on the Guidelines. The training programme will commence in spring 2024. Roll out to special schools is the initial stage and it is intended that the review of this training will inform a broader roll out to a wider range of schools. The NCSE is launching a call for tender (CfT) for the design, development and delivery of a comprehensive training programme on Understanding Behaviours of Concern and Responding to Crisis Situations for delivery to schools. Relevant training providers are invited to submit proposals for a comprehensive training programme related to the Guidelines, set out in Appendix 1a of this CfT document.",
