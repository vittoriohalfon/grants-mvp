    "description": "The Southern Regional Assembly is inviting tenders from suitably qualified applicants to provide specialist services for the design and delivery of: • A socio-economic impact analysis of the port sectors in the Southern Region to the State, Regional and Sub Regional economy, and of its future growth potential. This specialist study will provide an evidence base for the development of a Ports and Harbour Strategy for the Southern Region, which is a Regional Policy Objective (RPO) of the RSES for the Southern Region. RPO 145 Ports and Harbour Strategy for the Southern Region states: • It is an objective to support the development of a Ports and Harbour Strategy for the Southern Region to be prepared by the relevant stakeholders through consultation with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sports, Local Authorities, Port authorities, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, National Transport Authority, and other relevant stakeholders. The implementation mechanisms and monitoring structures to be established following the adoption of the RSES will identify the scope and role of the Ports and Harbour Strategy for the Southern Region and the appropriate timescale for its preparation. Progressing delivery of RPO 145 is identified in the RSES Two Year Monitoring Report 2020-2022 as a transformative initiative for the Region and is an implementation priority for the RSES. Consultation with the Department of Transport on the objectives of a Ports and Harbour Strategy for the Southern Region and how the work of the Regional Assembly can assist future review of National Ports Policy highlighted the need for an evidence base to inform recommendations forthcoming through the strategy. Therefore, an important step in the preparation of the Ports and Harbour Strategy for the Southern Region is to commission a socio-economic impact analysis of the sector in the Southern Region which will input directly into the development of the strategy. This analysis will help the Southern Regional Assembly communicate the economic impact (direct, indirect, and induced) of our Region’s port and harbour assets to our regional and national economy, the social and economic potential of these assets to drive balanced regional economic development and the potential economic growth (and economic benefit to the Region) in emerging sectors, especially as renewable energy hubs and economic activity generated by Off-Shore Renewable Energy. Importantly, this evidence base of existing economic impact and future potential will provide analysis to underpin regional level recommendations to central government, state authorities and relevant stakeholders and provide a mandate for regional bodies such as the Southern Regional Assembly to seek strengthened policy support, funding support and actions that sustainably develop our Region’s port and harbour assets. The Southern Regional Assembly will aid the service provider throughout the project including assistance with stakeholder engagement, consultation, and workshop event management as required.",
