    "description": "A significant length (approximately 200m) of this local tertiary road (L-52214), it’s junctions with two side roads and a house entrance in Cuan na Loinge, Ceantar na nOileán in the Conamara South Engineering area is inundated with seawater at very high tides and storm surge events on an ever-increasing basis. This results in the road being impassable for hours at a time. Up to 17 residences are affected by this. The OPW have a report dated from 2005 indicating this location as a problem area, with coastal flooding described then as occurring twice a year. The objective of this project is to raise the level of the road so that inundation events and inundation periods are significantly reduced, even for Highest Astronomical Tides (when storm surge and high tides coincide), but that the current road width, tidal patterns, and flows are not significantly altered. The final design must be sympathetic to the area, it’s heritage and its vistas. One of the main constraints on this project is its sensitive location from an environmental point of view. It is located in/along the Kilkieran Bay and Island SAC (Sitecode 002111).",
