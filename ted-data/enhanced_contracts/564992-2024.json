    "description": "**Title: The Provision of Cloud-Based Phone System to Horse Racing Ireland and Subsidiaries and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board**\n\n**Description:**\nHorse Racing Ireland (HRI) is a leading organization in the Irish horse racing industry, responsible for promoting and regulating horse racing in Ireland. The organization serves over 8,000 active clients, including owners, trainers, jockeys, valets, and agents. The current Avaya IP 500 V2 Phone System, installed in 2017, is used for external communication with these clients and other stakeholders.\n\nThe new cloud-based phone system must ensure seamless communication and efficient service delivery to HRI's diverse user base. Key requirements include:\n\n- **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle the current volume of users and be scalable to accommodate future growth.\n- **Reliability:** High uptime and minimal downtime are crucial to maintain continuous communication with clients and stakeholders.\n- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system should be easy to use, with intuitive features that minimize training time for users.\n- **Integration:** Compatibility with existing IT infrastructure and potential integration with other business systems are essential.\n- **Security:** Robust security measures to protect sensitive client information and ensure compliance with industry standards.\n- **Customer Support:** Reliable customer support and maintenance services are necessary to address any technical issues promptly.\n\nThe selected bidder should have experience in providing cloud-based phone systems to similar organizations, with a proven track record of reliability, scalability, and user satisfaction. The proposal should detail how the bidder will meet these requirements and ensure a smooth transition from the current Avaya system to the new cloud-based solution.",
